# CLAUDE.md Template

> Agent context file generated alongside SPEC.md. Short pointer file — not a duplication of the spec.

## Template

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

[Project Name] - [One-line description]

## Spec Reference

Primary spec: `SPEC.md`

→ When implementing API endpoints: `SPEC/api-reference.md`
→ When using [SDK/Library]: `SPEC/sdk-patterns.md`

## Key Constraints

- [Critical constraint 1 - surfaced from spec]
- [Critical constraint 2]
- [Out of scope reminder]

## Commands

```bash
[Generated based on tech stack]
```

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| [Layer] | [Tech] |

## Current Status

→ Check `SPEC.md` → Development Phases section
→ Start new dev sessions with `prompt.md`
```

## Generation Rules

1. Keep it short — pointer to SPEC.md, not a copy
2. Surface critical constraints directly (prevent missed context)
3. Include trigger-based references to any SPEC/ supplements
4. Include tech-stack-specific dev commands
5. Status always points to SPEC.md as single source
6. If prompt.md was generated, include the `→ Start new dev sessions with prompt.md` line in Current Status. Omit if no prompt.md.

## Supplement References

Include only when SPEC/ files exist:

```markdown
→ When implementing API endpoints: `SPEC/api-reference.md`
→ When using [SDK/Library]: `SPEC/sdk-patterns.md`
→ When designing data models: `SPEC/data-models.md`
```

Omit the References section entirely if no supplements were created.
