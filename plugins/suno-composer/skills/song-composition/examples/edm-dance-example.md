## Lyrics

[Intro: Atmospheric pads, filtered]

[Verse 1]
Lost in the city lights
Searching for something real
Every beat takes me higher
This is how freedom feels

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it rising
Electric in the air
We're chasing neon dreams tonight
Nothing can compare

[Build]
Neon dreams
Neon dreams
Neon dreams
(We're alive)

[Drop]
(instrumental - main synth hook)

[Verse 2]
Dancing through the midnight
Colors blur and fade
Every moment captured
Memories we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it rising
Electric in the air
We're chasing neon dreams tonight
Nothing can compare

[Build][filtered, tension rising]
Neon dreams
Neon dreams
Neon dreams
(We're alive)

[Drop][full energy]
(instrumental - main synth hook with vocal chops)

[Bridge][breakdown, stripped]
Close your eyes
Let go
Feel the sound
Let it flow

[Final Build]
Neon dreams...

[Final Drop][full arrangement]
(instrumental - extended with additional layers)

[Outro]
Neon dreams...
(fade with reverb tail)

**Note:** This example demonstrates EDM-specific metatag usage:
- `[Build]` and `[Drop]` are EDM structure tags
- `[Build][filtered, tension rising]` - arrangement change for second build
- `[Drop][full energy]` - arrangement descriptor
- `[Bridge][breakdown, stripped]` - contrast point
- `[Final Drop][full arrangement]` - climax marker
- Avoids stacking intensity words that cause cumulative escalation
