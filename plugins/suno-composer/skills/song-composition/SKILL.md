## Overview

This skill provides specialized knowledge for composing songs optimized for Suno AI music generation. It covers style tag syntax, genre conventions, song structure patterns, and lyric writing techniques across multiple languages and styles.

## Suno v5 Style Tags

## Professional Songwriter Techniques

Apply these proven techniques for more memorable, emotionally resonant songs:

### Hook-First Composition

Design the most memorable part first (usually chorus hook), then build around it:
1. Write the chorus hook (melodic, lyrical, or rhythmic)
2. Test memorability - can you hum it after one listen?
3. Build verses that create anticipation for the hook
4. Use pre-chorus to build tension before hook release

### Tension & Release

Structure emotional dynamics throughout the song:

```
Low Tension → Building → Peak → Release
[Verse]      [Pre-Chorus] [Chorus] [Post-Chorus]
```

**Build tension with:** rising pitch, added layers, syncopation, harmonic tension
**Release tension with:** landing on tonic, full instrumentation, longer notes

### Three-Element Arrangement

Limit to three main elements for clarity and flexibility:

| Element | Role | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| A | Main melody | Vocals, lead line |
| B | Counter-melody | Pads, strings |
| C | Rhythmic foundation | Bass, drums |

**Section combinations:**
- Verse: A + C (vocals over rhythm)
- Chorus: A + B + C (full impact)
- Bridge: B + C (contrast, rest vocals)
