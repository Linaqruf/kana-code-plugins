# Japanese Music Tier System

> **Tiers as Creative Compass**
>
> These tiers describe ecosystem positions and general vibes—not strict rules.
> A song can blend tier characteristics. An "anisong" can have "surface" complexity.
> Use tiers to understand the landscape, then chart your own path.

Reference database for J-pop ecosystem tiers. Use these as creative directions, not rigid categories.

## How to Use This File

1. Scan user input for tier keywords (case-insensitive)
2. If keyword found, load tier profile
3. Apply auto-tags and style preset to generation
4. If artist reference also present, merge (tier base + artist refinements)

## Tier + Artist Merging

When both tier and artist reference are present:

1. Start with tier's auto-tags
2. Add artist's specific characteristics
3. Artist overrides tier for conflicts (e.g., tempo, vocal type)
4. User's theme shapes the emotion arc

**Example:** `/suno anisong like Aimer about farewell`

Merge process:
- From tier: `[Anime OP]`, `[Dramatic Build]`, `[High Energy]`
- From Aimer profile: husky vocals, cinematic, ballad tendency, 70-130 BPM
- Result: Anisong structure + Aimer's vocal style + slower tempo

**Generated style prompt:**
```
J-rock anime opening with cinematic ballad influence, 120 bpm dramatic,
husky female vocals with emotional depth building to powerful delivery,
guitar-forward with orchestral strings, atmospheric reverb-heavy mix,
emotion arc: quiet longing → rising tension → bittersweet farewell
```
