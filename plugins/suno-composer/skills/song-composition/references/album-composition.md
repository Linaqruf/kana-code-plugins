# Album Composition Patterns

## Album Arc Templates

### Journey Arc (Most Common)
| Position | Role | Energy | Emotion |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| Track 1 | Opener | High hook | Invitation, sets tone |
| Track 2-3 | Rising | Building | Exploration, development |
| Track 4-5 | Peak/Turn | Climax or shift | Emotional high point |
| Track 6-7 | Descent | Cooling | Reflection, processing |
| Track 8+ | Resolution | Varied | Closure, callbacks |

### Concept Album Arc
- **Act 1 (25%):** Setup - Introduce themes, characters, world
- **Act 2 (50%):** Conflict - Develop tension, complications
- **Act 3 (25%):** Resolution - Climax and denouement

### EP/Mini-Album (3-6 tracks)
| Position | Role |
|----------|------|
| Track 1 | Statement - Your strongest, most representative |
| Track 2-4 | Exploration - Different angles on theme |
| Track 5-6 | Signature - Memorable closer |

## Coherence Techniques

### Thematic Anchors
- **Lyrical:** Recurring phrases, imagery, vocabulary pool
- **Sonic:** Signature instrument or production element
- **Structural:** Consistent song format or motif placement

### Sonic Palette Constraints
Define these for album consistency:
- **Core Instruments:** 3-4 instruments present across all tracks
- **Production Family:** Related production styles (e.g., all lo-fi, all polished)
- **Tempo Range:** Keep within 40 BPM range for cohesion
- **Key Relationships:** Related keys (relative major/minor, circle of fifths neighbors)

### Track Transition Guidelines
- **Tempo:** Adjacent tracks within 15 BPM or intentional contrast
- **Energy:** Avoid two high-energy or two low-energy tracks adjacent
- **Key:** Smooth transitions via relative keys or pivot chords
- **Mood:** Emotional logic in sequencing

## Position-Specific Guidelines

### Openers
- Immediate hook (first 15 seconds)
- Representative of album's sonic palette
- Sets thematic expectations
- Higher energy preferred
- Tags: `[Intro: Short, impactful]`

### Journey Tracks
- Develop themes introduced in opener
- Can experiment with tempo/mood variation
- Include callbacks to opener elements
- Build narrative momentum

### Closers
- Resolve thematic threads
- Often returns to opener's key or tempo
- Longer outro acceptable
- Emotional payoff required
- Tags: `[Outro: Resolution, fade or definitive end]`

## Album Types
